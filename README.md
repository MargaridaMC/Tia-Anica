Simple Android app with on-the-go Geocaching tools

Initial commit includes only alphabetic string to numeric conversion (for example, ABC = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6) and a Vigen√®re Cipher encoder/decoder.
The application works fully offline.

More features will be added with time depending on what we feel is required while out in the cache field. Suggestions are also accepted. There are not plans to bring this to the iPhone.

# Tia-Anica
Simple Android app with on-the-go Geocaching tools

At the moment the included functionalities are:

1. Alpha sum calculator: Calculates the sum of the letters in a word, when these are converted to letter, e.g. A = 1, B = 2, C = 3...

2. Vignère Cipher: Encodes and Decodes a message using the Vignère Cipher.

3. Coordinate Calculator: Taking a formula for the coordinates of a geocache (such as N48º 34.A(B + C)D E 10º 52.(D * 2)FG) this replaces the letter with the appropriate values and computes the final coordinates. It also works with just simple formulas (not formatted like coordinates) like c*2 + 10.

4. Coordinate offset calculator: Calculates the coordinates you end up with if you move in a certain angle (in degrees) and a certain distance (in metres) from some intial coordinates.

Next on the list to be added is a Notes section.

The application works fully offline.

More features will be added with time depending on what we feel is required while out in the cache field. Suggestions are also accepted. There are not plans to bring this to the iPhone.

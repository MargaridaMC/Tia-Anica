# Tia Anica and Ti'Aires
## Your friendly geocaching aunts
*Simple Android app with on-the-go Geocaching tools*

At the moment the included functionalities are:

1. **AlphaSum calculator**: Calculates the sum of the letters in a word, when these are converted to letter, e.g. A = 1, B = 2, C = 3...

2. **Vignère Cipher**: Encodes and Decodes a message using the Vignère Cipher.

3. **Coordinate Calculator**: Taking a formula for the coordinates of a geocache (such as N48º 34.A(B + C)D E 10º 52.(D * 2)FG) this replaces the letter with the appropriate values and computes the final coordinates. It also works with just simple formulas (not formatted like coordinates) like c*2 + 10.

4. **Coordinate Offset calculator**: Calculates the coordinates you end up with if you move in a certain angle (in degrees) and a certain distance (in metres) from some intial coordinates.

The application works fully offline.

## Backlog

New features to be developed are work items here: https://dev.azure.com/joamart/Tia%20Anica/_workitems/recentlyupdated/

More features will be added with time depending on what we feel is required while out in the cache field. Suggestions are also accepted. There are no plans to bring this to the iPhone.
